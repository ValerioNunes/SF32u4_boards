===========================

This contains support for the following SparkFun 32u4 based Arduino-compatible development boards:
* [ProMicro 5V](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11098)

### Installation Instructions

To add this support to your Arduino IDE, simply copy the "sparkfun" folder, and all of its contents, into a "hardware" directory in one of two
places:
* The actual Arduino directory
	* Directory structure example: C:/Program Files (x86)/Arduino/hardware/sparkfun/avr
* Inside your Sketchbook directory
	* Directory structure example: C:/Users/userName/Arduino/hardware/sparkfun/avr

### Notes

* **Please note: This will only work under Arduino IDE versions 1.5 and up.**
* **For Arduino 1.0.X Compatibility**: Please download our [release for Arduino 1.0.6 and earlier](https://github.com/sparkfun/SF32u4_boards/releases/tag/pre-1.6).
* Information on compiling and programming the bootloader can be found in the bootloader directory.
